This directory contains auto-generated file templates. This is a custom part of
the Alpha build system. When 'make' is run (specifically 'make autogen', but
this is done automatically), the following will happen:

    read key=value pairs from "autogen.conf"
    for each file ending in ".auto" under autogen/
        strip out first line - call this "path"
        for each key in autogen.conf
            replace all occurrences of %%key%% in file by value
        save new file as "path" relative to source root

These files will be cleaned up by 'make clean'
